"Proper" Property Progression

This is a mod that changes the progression through the properties of Schedule I.

So instead of starting with the Motel you have to repair your mangled RV first (forgot to tell yall you gotta talk to marco).  
Also increases the price of the Motel, the Sweatshop, and the Bungalow.   
(the little picture in Ray's doesn't update because that sounds hard)  
- RV = $500 (She'll never move again im afraid ðŸ˜”)  
- Motel = $2,500  
- Sweatshop = $8,000  
- Bungalow = $35,000
- Barn = $80,000
- Warehouse = $100,000
- Manor (not implemented in this mod, but you can still edit it's price)  

Now affects the businesses too!  
- Laundromat = $10,000
- PostOffice = $20,000
- Car Wash = $40,000
- Taco Ticklers = $70,000  

All launder amounts are set to $5,000.

Includes some config settings so you can customize your experience.  
By default everything in the RV is deleted at start, if you want to disable that go into the config.  
I dont want people cheating by picking up RV items. You start with nothing.  
(btw you start with $475, have fun picking up trash!) *Laughs in pickpocket*

UPDATE  
Unlocked Albert after fixing RV

UPDATE 2
Fixed bug where your RV gets wiped everytime you enter your save.
